      <p>I am Mechanical Engineer with a total of 13 years in the technical field. I am also a mother of a beautiful 6, almost 7, years old boy. I took a career break to take care of him, while also giving my husband to persuade his career goals. We have travelled around, lived in Australia, Brazil, China, and USA. Now I am in a stage of learning new skills that will allow me to work from anywhere in the world to keep us moving around as we wish.</p>
